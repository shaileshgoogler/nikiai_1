# Niki.ai Coding Assignment

The approach used here has time complexity O(n). Looking at the test cases, it has to be something smaller than that for the actual contraints to work (some mathematical formula). Hence, I searched the problem and the solution was **(n+2)th fibonacci** number which can be calculated mathematically.
